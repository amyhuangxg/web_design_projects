      <h2>Paul Ford, <i>What is Code?</i> & Frank Chimero, <i>What Screens Want</i></h2>

      <p>I think that, more than anything, what the beginning narration of <i>What is Code?</i> reveals is a common sense of intimidation and mystery that is associated with the world of code. This association owes a lot to its intangible nature, as well as its linguistic properties.</p>

      <p>From what I've learnt in the course so far, code and language seem to be perfect analogies for each other and, of course, inform each other. Both are developed based on human logic, both place abstract labels on elements, and both use these elements with different roles and syntax to communicate a message. Most importantly, both are confusing to people who don't understand them but become powerful tools for those with the will to learn.</p>

      <p>Ford then goes on to demystify code for the ready and give a little historical background on its development. This I found informative, but found myself appreciating it more when I read it a second time with the context of what I learnt from What Screens Want.</p>

      <p>In <i>What Screens Want</i>, Chimero takes a more abstract, out-side-in approach to explain the significance of code. I especially liked the analogy that he drew between code and plastic to characterize it as something that has its own inherent properties but can easily be used to mimic and replace other materials or media.</p>

      <p>I think that the main challenge with such a malleable medium is the question that Chimero leaves us with. What do we want? Of course it’s important to understand how code best, but like any other material, tool, or language, after the demystification, what really matters is what we use it for.</p>

      <h2>Olia Lialina, <i>Vernacular Web 1</i> & Alexander R. Galloway, <i>Jodi's Infrastructure</i></h2>

      <p><i>Vernacular Web 1</i> was really fun and interesting as it made me remember a lot of the so called "amateur" websites that I still remember seeing on my family's cube desktop computer. I feel like while design has improved websites in many ways - and is literally  our jobs - it’s taken away the ratchet playfulness of the early web. If the web now is porcelain, then these web pages are like Playdoh: not something that is refined, but something that is loved nonetheless precisely because its lowly status allows and invites play.</p>

      <p>The way that these amateur sites are formatted also reveals a lot about the features of web code. It's easy to tell that choosing text colour and font is relatively easy since most of these pages  have a least five of each simple because they can. I remember that, in the previous reading, Chimero stated that code is malleable to a point where it almost has no inherent properties. This affect can certainly be achieved. However, what these early examples of web design and my own progress in the course made me realise is that there are some features that are more easily access and changed than others. Hence, these layers of complexity could be one of the major influences on which properties and features we see and don't see on the web.</p>

      <p>The structure of these properties and features are brought into question in <i>Jodi's Infrastructure</i>. Galloway asks "Do you think of yourself as primarily working “on” the digital or primarily “within” it?" I think that this very "modern" question can be asked of any medium: "Do you think of yourself as primarily working “on” the field of (insert any field of art, science, etc. here) or primarily “within” it?" We have become hyperaware of the effectiveness of the systems within which we operate and have become more invested in working "on" them, not just "within" them.</p>

      <p>I think that generally, as well as specifically in regards to web design, this is a positive thing as, by questioning and reorganising such structures, we can find better and more meaningful ways to do the work "within".</p>

      <h2>Samuel Earle, <i>Capitalism vs. Privacy</i> & Louise Drulhe, <i>Critical Atlas of Internet</i></h2>

      <p>Both <i>Capitalism vs. Privacy</i> and <i>Critical Atlas of Internet</i> take a step back to look at the bigger picture of how and where data travels.</p>

      <p>What I found interesting about <i>Critical Atlas of Internet</i> is the physical and visual way in which the internet is represented. The "hourglass" model stood out to me especially. It presents an incredibly common phenomenon: using search engines to access the web. However, only when I saw it graphically did I realise just how big a role search engines play as they direct and redirect such a large quantity of net traffic.</p>

      <p>While Drulhe's graphic presentations reveal the footprint and geographies of our data, Earle analysises the significance of some of these data trends. Specifically, <i>Capitalism Vs. Privacy</i> looks at personal data as a collective - big data - and how this data is used and/or misused.</p>

      <p>My opinion is that companies who provide free services, such as Facebook, should have the right to collect and sell anonymous user statistics. However, the real issue arises when users' data is collected, then used "against" them to target their interests by selectively including and excluding certain types of content.</p>

      <p>The issue here is not only the potentially unwanted content that the viewer is shown. More importantly, this form of data collection mandates that each user be tracked through many of their online activities. Instead of appearing as a data point in a few unrelated samples, people are traced and followed in their daily lives.</p>

      <h2>Doc Searls and David Weinberger, <i>New Clues</i></h2>

      <p><i>New Clues</i> is interesting because, while it starts of as a manifesto, it takes on a somewhat explanatory or didactic tone, transforming it back into more of an article despite the continued "manifesto" layout.</p>

      <p>Although Searls and Weinberger start off by claiming that the internet is "for everything", they present many suggestions of what the internet should not be for, especially when it comes to advertising or data collection. I agree with a lot of their reasoning and understand why they have complaints against these uses of the internet.</p>

      <p>However, limiting or omitting these aspects of the web must sacrifice some of the "free for all" nature that the authors emphasized was integral to being connected. Of course, with freedom comes both the chance to do good and harm.</p>

      <p>The businesses who exploit this aren't stupid. They're going to use whatever means are effective. Hence, if we really want to change the way ads are communicated, it is the audience or the "consumers" that need to change. Searls and Weinberger say that "consumer" is a dirty word because it makes livestock out of us, but if we’re so easily herded by sensationalized clickbait, do we really deserve to be seen as more than cows or sheep?</p>

      <p>If we want to demand better marketing, we have to have better taste. If we want to protect our data, we need to sacrifice our free accounts and make laws and limitations that disincentivize companies from collecting such data.</p>

      <p>Essentially, I agree with the authors' first two claims. Which is why I cannot fully agree with many of their others. The internet is us. The internet is nothing and has no purpose. Hence, we are all what make the internet what it is and what it will be. There is no way one or two people can decide what is should be for themselves. But they can write an article about it. And they can put it on the internet for others to read.</p>
